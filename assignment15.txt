mysql> create table Multicust as select * from SALESPEOPLE where snum in (select snum from CUSTOMERS group by snum having
count(cnum)>1);

mysql> select * from Multicust;
+------+---------+----------+------+
| Snum | Sname   | City     | Comm |

3) Write a command that increases by twenty percent the commissions of all
salespeople with total orders above Rs. 3,000.

mysql> select * from SALESPEOPLE;
