1) Write two different queries that would produce all orders taken on October 3 rd or
4 th , 1990.
==>
select * from ORDERS where Odate in('1990-10-03','1990-10-04');
==>This query work fast because 'in'keyword is already present in DB in compile format. 
select * from ORDERS where Odate='1990-10-03' or Odate='1990-10-04';
==>This will work slower than above one.

2) Write a query that selects all of the customers serviced by Peel or Motika.
(Hint: the snum field relates the two tables to one another).
==>select cname from CUSTOMERS where snum in (select snum from SALESPEOPLE where sname='peel' or  sname='motika');

3) Write a query that will produce all the customers whose names begin with a letter
from ‘A’ to ‘G’.
==>SELECT *FROM CUSTOMERS WHERE substr(cname,1,1) BETWEEN 'A' AND 'G';

4) Write a query that selects all customers whose names begin with the letter ‘C’.
==>select cname from CUSTOBERS where cname like'c%';

5) Write a query that selects all orders except those with zeroes or NULLs in the amt
field.
==>select * from ORDERS where amt os not NULL and amt<>0;
