Assignment â€“ 16
Creating Tables and Indexes.
1) Write a command that will enable a user to pull orders grouped by date out of the
Orders table quickly.
==>
Create index i_order on ORDERS(Odate);

2) If the Orders table has already been created, how can you force the onum field to
be unique (assume all current values are unique)?
==>
Alter table ORDERS add pk_onum PRIMARY key(onum);

3) Create an index that would permit each salesperson to retrieve his or her orders
grouped by date quickly.
==>
Create index i_order on ORDERS(Odate);

4) Let us assume that each salesperson is to have only one customer of a given
rating, and that this is currently the case. Enter a command that enforces it.
==>
alter table CUSTOMERS add CONSTRAINT pk_rating PRIMARY KEY(rating);
