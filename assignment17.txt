Assignment â€“ 17

Constraining the Values of your data.

1) Create the Orders table so that all onum values as well as all combinations of
cnum and snum are different from one another, and so that NULL values are
excluded from the date field.
==>
Crate table ORDERS
(
onum int ,
cnum int,
snum int,
Odate date not null,
primary key(onum,cnum,snum) //composite key
);


2) Create the Salespeople table so that the default commission is 10% with no
NULLS permitted, snum is the primary key, and all names fall alphabetically
between A and M, inclusive (assume all names will be uppercase).
==>

create table SALESPEOPLE 
(
comm int default comm=0.10,
snum int primary key,
sname char(20) check sname=upper(sname) and substre(upper(sname),1,1) between 'A' and 'M'
);

3) Create the Orders table, making sure that the onum is greater than the cnum, and
the cnum is greater that the snum. Allow no NULLS in any of these three fields.
==>
create table ORDERS1
(
onum int not null ,
cnum int not null ,
snum int not null,
constraint on_cn_sn check(onum>cnum and cnum>snum)
);
